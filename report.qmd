## Introduction

There are concerns that the provision of some urology services, particularly functional urology,Â  is not meeting the needs of patients adequately. This gap in provision could lead to delayed or prevented diagnosis and treatment resulting in poor quality of life and negative health outcomes for patients. The aim of this project is to produce a quantitative analysis to explore and quantify the underlying level of need in the Midlands for a selection of common functional urological conditions and using that to begin to quantify the scale of some of the gaps in Urology provision.

## Methodology

### Underlying need

Prevalence studies from the literature for the selected conditions were considered with the aim to obtain detailed age and gender specific prevalence rate estimates.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia:

Prevalence rates were taken from, "The global burden of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis" by Lee, Chan & Lai (2017).

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06628-8>

This article was chosen as it provided prevalence rates consistent with other literature, but included prevalence rates by age. This condition is only relevant to males.

```{r}

select(prev_bph, -prevpercent_female) |>
  gt()|>
  cols_label(age_group_bph = "Age Group",
             prevpercent_male = "Prevalence (%)") |>
  tab_header(
    title = 'Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Prevalence'
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = "Source: Lee, Chan & Lai (2017)")
```

Overactive Bladder:

Prevalence rates were taken from, "Prevalence of the Overactive Bladder Syndrome by Applying the International Continence Society Definition" by Temml, Heidler, Ponholzer and Madersbacher (2005).

<https://ginegap.com/materiales-cursos/bibliografia/m1-c1/52_Temml_2005.pdf>

This article was chosen as it provided prevalence rates consistent with other literature, used the International Continence Society (ICS) definitions, and included prevalence rates by both age and gender.

```{r}
prev_oab |>
  gt()|>
  cols_label(age_group_oab = "Age Group",
             prevpercent_male = "Male Prevalence (%)",
             prevpercent_female = "Female Prevalence (%)")|>
  tab_header(
    title = 'Overactive Bladder Prevalence'
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = "Source: Temml, Heidler, Ponholzer and Madersbacher (2005)")
```

Post prostatectomy incontinence:

Prevalence rates were taken from, "Prevalence analysis of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy and influential preoperative factors in a single institution" by Robles, Hevia, Algarra, Diez-Cabellero and Pascual (2017).

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2017.1369944>

This article was chosen as it also used the ICS definitions. This condition relates only to male patients, of whom the article states that 23% remain incontinent 12 months after a prostatectomy.

For both Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Overactive Bladder the prevalence rates obtained from the literature were applied to the GP practice list sizes to obtain prevalence estimates for each practice, taking account of the gender and age profile of the practice.

Applying the rates to the GP list sizes this gives an indication of the underlying level of need for each GP practice. The population need was then aggregated to generate need for each sub-ICB and each ICB with the intention of providing quantification of underlying need at both strategic and a more local/operational level.

### Treatment to need ratios

Treatment to need ratios have been calculated by directly comparing levels of condition specific treatment activity to the prevalence estimates. The ratios are activity divided by need.

The analysis has considered hospital surgical treatments (including inpatient, day case and outpatient treatments) using surgical procedure data as well as primary care management using condition specific prescribing data.

For the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Overactive Bladder conditions the surgical procedure activity was a count by GP practice of the number of patients with at least one spell (Elective or Daycase) for a relevant procedure in the 5 year period (April 2018 to March 2023) with a Urology (101) treatment function code and a relevant diagnosis code (see appendix). Where a patient had more than one spell then the most recent spell was used to assign them to a GP practice.

For the Post Prostatectomy Incontinence condition the surgical procedure activity was one of two definitions; 1) a count by GP practice of the number of patients in a 5-year period (April 2013 to March 2023), with at least one spell (Elective or Daycase) in which a procedure took place, with a Urology (101) treatment function code and a relevant diagnosis code (see appendix) in any position, who had previously (1 to 6 years prior, April 2012 to March 2017) had a spell in which they had a prostatectomy procedure; and 2) a count by GP practice of the number of patients in a 5-year period (April 2013 to March 2023), with at least one spell (Elective or Daycase) with a Urology (101) treatment function code and a relevant primary diagnosis code (see appendix), who had previously (1 to 6 years prior, April 2012 to March 2017) had a spell in which they had a prostatectomy procedure.

Outpatient Data

The Urology outpatient data rarely includes diagnosis codes (only 4% of attendances). Procedures that take place in outpatients are also not consistently recorded. Consequently it's not possible to give a robust picture of activity in relation to these specific conditions for use in calculating a treatment to need ratio. It is however possible to provide a description of the distribution of Urology outpatient activity across the Midlands region. Outpatient data was obtained from the SUS data as counts of outpatient attendances between April 2018 and March 2023 with a treatment function code of 101.

Prescribing data

Condition specific prescribing data was used as a proxy for / to reflect primary care management of the conditions. Prescribing data was obtained from *OpenPrescribing.net, Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, University of Oxford, 2023*

Built-in APIs were used from

<https://openprescribing.net/>

This is anoymised data about the drugs prescribed by GPs and drugs are organised and coded into relevant chapters. The detail of the drugs, codes and chapters used for each condition can be seen in the appendix.

The activity was taken as a count of prescription items by sub-ICB over the most recent 5 year period available.

### Analysis by GP practice

During the five-year period of time of the activity data there have been changes in GP practices and their sizes, including closures, mergers etc. When reporting data at GP practice level, any practice with a list size that has changed by more than 20% over this 5 year period has been excluded from the reporting. The data has however been included in reporting at sub-ICB and ICB level.

## FINDINGS:

### Inpatients

#### Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia:

##### Prevalence

The prevalence for each sub-ICB was calculated by dividing the age and gender specific prevalence calculated for the sub-ICB and dividing this by the overall total list size for the respective sub-ICB. The highest overall prevalence rates are in Stafford and Surrounds (05V) sub-ICB and Herefordshire and Worcestershire (18C) ICB. Prevalence rates are the lowest in Leicester City (04C) sub-ICB.

##### Activity to Need Ratio

The BPH activity to need ratios indicate that Bassetlaw (02Q) sub-ICB and Herefordshire and Worcestershire (18C) ICB have the highest level of activity relative to the underlying need. The lowest level of activity relative to the underlying need is in Leicester City (04C) sub-ICB and Stoke-on-Trent (05W) sub-ICB.

##### Activity Gap

The variation in activity to need ratios results in an activity gap and in order to attempt to quantify this activity gap, the activity to need ratio for the sub-ICB with the highest ratio has been applied to all other sub-ICBs and an estimated number of inpatient spells calculated as well as the % increase in activity that this represents. The table below shows that Leicester City (04C) sub-ICB would need a 119% increase in activity to increase its activity to need ratio to the same as Bassetlaw (02Q) sub-ICB.

#### Overactive Bladder:

For the Overactive Bladder condition, the highest overall prevalence rates are in North Staffordshire (05G) sub-ICB and Lincolnshire (71E) ICB. Prevalence rates are the lowest in Leicester City 04C.

```

Where conditions relate to both male and female patients the results will be stratified by gender to inform an assessment of potential gender inequity in treatment access/provision.

##### Activity to Need Ratio

The overactive bladder activity to need ratios indicate that Bassetlaw (02Q) sub-ICB and East Leicestershire and Rutland (03W) sub-ICB have the highest level of activity relative to the underlying need. The lowest level of activity relative to the underlying level of need is in Leicester City (04C) sub-ICB and Birmingham and Solihull (15E) ICB.

##### Activity Gap

As with Benign Prostatetic Hyperplasia there is an activity gap for Overactive Bladder and in order to attempt to quantify this activity gap, the activity to need ratio for the sub-ICB with the highest ratio has been applied to all other sub-ICBs and an estimated number of inpatient spells calculated as well as the % increase in activity that this represents.

#### Post Prostatectomy Incontinence:

##### Prevalence

The post-prostatectomy incontinence prevalence for each sub-ICB was calculated differently to the other conditions, by dividing the age and gender specific prevalence calculated for the sub-ICB and dividing this by the overall total list size for the respective sub-ICB. The highest overall prevalence rates are in Herefordshire and Worcestershire (18C) ICB and Bassetlaw (02Q) sub-ICB. Prevalence rates are the lowest in Leicester City (04C) sub-ICB.

##### Activity to Need Ratio

The post prostatectomy incontinence activity to need ratios indicate that Stafford and Surrounds (05V) sub-ICB and Bassetlaw (02Q) sub-ICB have the highest level of activity relative to the underlying need. The lowest level of activity is in North Staffordshire (05G) sub-ICB and Lincolnshire (71E) ICB.

Funnel plots

The sub-ICB plots below show the activity to need ratios for each GP practice plotted according to the underlying need for the condition and with confidence intervals for the whole of the Midlands region. GP practices that are outside the limits for the Midlands region are labelled. Within the two sub-ICBs with the highest activity to need ratios all GP practices are within the confidence limits.

Again, as with other conditions, there is an activity gap for Post prostatectomy Incontinence and in order to attempt to quantify this activity gap, the activity to need ratio for the sub-ICB with the highest ratio has been applied to all other sub-ICBs and an estimated number of inpatient spells calculated as well as the % increase in activity that this represents. The table below shows that North Staffordshire (05G) sub-ICB would need a 157% increase in activity to increase its activity to need ratio to the same as Stafford and Surrounds (05V) sub-ICB.

### Outpatients

There were 2.3 million (2,304,785) Urology outpatient attendances (new and follow-up) in the Midlands region in the five-year period April 2018 to March 2023.

```{r}

table_data <-midlandsoutpatients |>
  filter(der_appointment_type != "N/A") |>
  group_by(der_financial_year,der_appointment_type) |>
  summarise(total = sum(numattends)) |>
  ungroup()

  pivot_wider(names_from = der_appointment_type, values_from = total, id_cols = der_financial_year) |>

  tab_header(
    title = 'Urology Outpatient Attendances - Midlands'
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = "Data: SUS")
    
```

The Urology outpatient data rarely includes diagnosis codes (only 4% of attendances). Procedures that take place in outpatients are also not consistently recorded. Consequently it's not possible to give a robust picture of activity in relation to these conditions. In the map and table below, it can be seen that over a five year peiod (April 2018 to March 2023), the ICB with the largest volume of Urology outpatient new attendances is Lincolnshire (71E) ICB with 99.61 per 1000 list size population and Leicester City (04C) has the lowest with 30.09 per 1000 list size population.

## Conclusion

(The medications are not particularly effective and when a patient is on multiple other medications its not necessarily a good idea to go on these drugs. Consultants say they want a patient on it but GP's then discuss with patient and when they learn of side effects etc then can decide not to (esp if elderly). Good treatment options are unfortunately limited.) - Matt
