Initial stage of this project involves using the openprescribing.net website and accessing the data using an API to obtain details about prescribing data for medications for urology conditions

Second stage is to calculate need for four(?) functional urology conditions; BPH, OAB, PPI and UI using the latest GP list size by age and gender (currently March 2023) and applying prevalence rates obtained from the literature to these populations.
